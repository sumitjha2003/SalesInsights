## **Data Analysis Using MySQL**

Data was imported into **MySQL** to identify patterns, filter incorrect values, and assess performance by region. Some key queries include:  
- **Retrieve all customers**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sales.customers;
  ```
- **Revenue for Chennai in 2020**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(sales_amount) 
  FROM sales.transactions 
  INNER JOIN sales.date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
  WHERE date.year = 2020 AND market_code = 'Mark001';
  ```
- **Filter invalid transactions**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sales.transactions WHERE sales_amount < 0 OR currency = 'USD';
  ```

## **Data Cleaning & ETL Process**  
Data from MySQL was loaded into **Power BI** for transformation:  
1. **Filtered Null & Invalid Values**: Cleaned tables with blank entries and negative sales amounts.  
2. **Currency Conversion**:  
   USD values were converted to INR for consistent reporting. Formula used in Power Query:  
   ```  
   if [currency] = "USD" then [sales_amount] * 75 else [sales_amount]
   ```  
3. **Removed Duplicates**: Unnecessary duplicates of currency fields were deleted for clarity.

## **Data Modeling**  
A **star schema** was built to efficiently connect transactions, customers, markets, and dates, ensuring optimal data relationships for the dashboard.

---

## **DAX Metrics and Insights**  
Key metrics used in Power BI:  
- **Revenue**:  
  ```dax
  SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])
  ```
- **Profit Margin %**:  
  ```dax
  DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin], [Revenue], 0)
  ```
- **Revenue YoY Comparison**:  
  ```dax
  CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date]))
  ```

## **Dashboard & Visualization in Power BI**

The dashboard provided visual insights into revenue, profit margins, and regional performance. Some key metrics include:
- Revenue and profit trends by region and product.
- Year-over-year (YoY) comparison of key financial indicators.
- Profit contribution percentage across various business segments.

## **Tools & Technologies Used**  
1. **MySQL**: For database management and analysis.  
2. **Microsoft Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and reporting.  
3. **Power Query**: For data transformation.  
4. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For building custom metrics.
